    <p>The dock is composed of five icons that have the following purposes (the trashbin does nothing) :</p>
    <p class="imaged">
        <img src="../images/icons/finder-icon.png" alt="finder" class="lefted">
        The finder opens a window that reveals my projets. With multiple icons that you can click on. Each of those will open a safari window with a webpage describing the relevant project you clicked onto.
    </p>
    <p class="imaged">
        <img src="../images/icons/safari-icon.png" alt="" class="lefted">
        The safari is a web browser that, sadly, won't be able to open external websites (such as <a href="https://www.google.com/" target="_blank">Google</a>), because of their CORS policy. It is here to help you view local websites such as the page that you are currently reading. Clicking on the icon will lead you to this page. However, you can change the value of the field above to the following :
        <ul>
            <li><b>guide</b> → Leads you to this page</li>
            <li><b>about me</b> → Learn more about me :)</li>
            <li><b>about this project</b> → Learn more about the project you are currently interacting with</li>
            <li><b>chinese portrait</b> → Leads you to my chinese portrait</li>
            <li><b>web resume</b> → Leads you to my web resume</li>
            <li><b>quoridor</b> → Leads you to my Quoridor game project</li>
            <li><b>video resume</b> → Leads you to my video resume</li>
            <li><b>escape</b> → Leads you to my motion design "Escape" project</li>
            <li><b>stagengo</b> → Leads you to my group project called "Stage'N'Go", built to link both students seeking an intership and their potential recruiters</li>
            <li><b>reah</b> → Leads you to my group project called "Reah", built for a better content sharing</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p class="imaged">
        <img src="../images/icons/messages-icon.png" alt="messages" class="lefted">
        The messages app opens a chat app that is actually a form. In an interactive way, you can fill the field below, answer the queries and send me a message this way.
    </p>
    <p class="imaged">
        <img src="../images/icons/github-icon.png" alt="GitHub" class="lefted">
        <img src="../images/icons/linkedin-icon.png" alt="LinkedIn" class="lefted">
