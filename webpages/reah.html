        <h1>Reah</h1>

        <h2>Overview</h2>

        <p>The modern entertainment have become more and more visual, putting long texts aside. Nowadays, we consume content as we consume a burger. Ten bites and it is integrated, a day and itâ€™s forgotten. We consume digital content in an ephemera way, without truly exploring the full potential of what social media and video content have to offer.
        <br><br>
        We said no. We created Reah.
        <br><br>
        Reah is a digital platform that places creativity and quality first. Host of short movies made by everyone, it is a safe place to create, watch and enjoy quality content made by passionated people far away from ready-to-go content available elsewhere. Implicating its community in a dynamic way, Reah involve regular challenges that push the talents of the community at their full potential in order to bring to the world awesome creations, showing diversity of creations and plurality of sights all around a single topic.
        <br><br>
        The project is built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP and MySQL languages.
