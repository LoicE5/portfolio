        <h2>Overview</h2>

        <p>Epitome of the self introduction, the Chinese portrait consists of multiple statements such as « If I was [something], I would be [something] ». Not only a way to self-introduce to an audience, this project depicts a real artistic sight, not only through the choice of the statements, but also through the way to argue about these. It is even more relevant in a web format because the artistic aspect of the project meets technicality.
        <br><br>
        My Chinese portrait have been realized using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and the ThreeJS library. I wanted to create something out of the box, so I decided to use the Z axis instead of the basics both vertical & horizontal axis for the user to navigate. In that way every text, illustration and sometimes audio appears to the user like he is navigating through a space field.
