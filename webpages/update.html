    <h1>Hello there!</h1>
    <p>I'm happy you're coming to see my portfolio.</p>
    <p>I built this website in 2020 at the beginning of my coding journey.</p>
    <p>It's not the best project to showcase my today's skills with much more modern technologies and coding practices but hey, it's still online!</p>
    <p>The information in this website might be obsolete for most and some features have been disabled (such as the contact form). Also, you might encounter some bugs along the way, although I didn't find many myself when browsing this website three years after its initial release.</p>
    <p>Have a good time here, you can check my <a href="https://github.com/LoicE5" target="_blank">GitHub</a> & <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/loic-etienne" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> by clicking these icons on the dock below!</p>
