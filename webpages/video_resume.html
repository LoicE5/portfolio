        <h1>Video Resume</h1>

        <h2>Overview</h2>

        <p>A video resume is an original self-introduction performed in a short video (usually less than three minutes). The goal is to show the most of our capabilities in a dynamic way and in a short timestamp. The usage of visual effects, compositing, chroma key and such techniques is relevant for a video resume.
        <br><br>
        My video resume project is shot on green screen, which allow a better illustration of my sayings. Moreover, this brings another dimension to the resume, making it more dynamic. The principle is quite simple, and is based on the 2012â€™s YouTube universe. I mock a FAQ video answering fake Twitter questions based on an hashtag that have never existed.

        This project have been made thanks to the HitFilm Pro software brought by FXHOME.
