    <h1>About this project</h1>
    <p>My portfolio was a challenge both on the thinking aspect as well as the realization aspect. At first, my sight wasn’t clear about the concept that I wanted to develop. I then looked at my MacOs desktop interface and thinker « Hmm… Yeah, I could do that ». Actually, the aim was to make the visitor discover at his rhythm the website, seeking the informations not for long enough to be boring, and not easily enough to be benign. The perfect balance between those components was to disseminate the information in the perfect way to stimulate the visitor without boring him, making him want to always discover more, and be satisfied of what he see and the way he can interact.
    </p>
    <p>That's in that aim that I built my portfolio in this way. I hope that you are enjoying it. Do not hesitate to seek the few easter eggs I've put in it, or write <i>"guide"</i> in the input field above, then press enter, to have a better understanding of how this portfolio actually works if you need to.
