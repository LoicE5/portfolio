        <h1>Web Resume</h1>

        <h2>Overview</h2>

        <p>In the world of self introduction, and especially within the digital field, being original is a real advantage. Thatâ€™s why I decided to take profit of my web development skills to create my very own web resume.
        <br><br>
        Creating a web resume shows multiple advantages. At first, it directly shows to the audience what my skills can render, which is way better than writing them down on a PDF Resume. Â«Â An image is worth more than 1000 wordsÂ Â».
        <br><br>
        Plus, it is interactive. Much more information can be put in it, and it wonâ€™t look like unpalatable. The potential recruiter can navigate as he will and seek further information on  topics that catch his attention.
        <br><br>
        Moreover, it is entirely customizable. There is no limits others than bandwidth and performance, which are highly permissive.
        <br><br>
        Finally, a web resume can include a call-to-action, which can be as an example a simple form with a Â«Â sendÂ Â» button. This can slightly increase the number of mails received. 
        <br><br>
        I made my web Resume using HTML, CSS, JavaScript & PHP languages, and in a one-page format. I dimensioned photos in order to make them fit the best within the webpage, and created some animations to make the website looks better. The one-page format was helpful to convince the audience that this isnâ€™t a resume, but a story. At the end, I used PHP (with an MySQL database connection) in order to fulfill the call-to-action requirement that I believe mandatory in a such project.
