        <h1>Web Resume</h1>

        <h2>Overview</h2>

        <p>In the world of self introduction, and especially within the digital field, being original is a real advantage. That’s why I decided to take profit of my web development skills to create my very own web resume.
        <br><br>
        Creating a web resume shows multiple advantages. At first, it directly shows to the audience what my skills can render, which is way better than writing them down on a PDF Resume. « An image is worth more than 1000 words ».
        <br><br>
        Plus, it is interactive. Much more information can be put in it, and it won’t look like unpalatable. The potential recruiter can navigate as he will and seek further information on  topics that catch his attention.
        <br><br>
        Moreover, it is entirely customizable. There is no limits others than bandwidth and performance, which are highly permissive.
        <br><br>
        Finally, a web resume can include a call-to-action, which can be as an example a simple form with a « send » button. This can slightly increase the number of mails received. 
        <br><br>
        I made my web Resume using HTML, CSS, JavaScript & PHP languages, and in a one-page format. I dimensioned photos in order to make them fit the best within the webpage, and created some animations to make the website looks better. The one-page format was helpful to convince the audience that this isn’t a resume, but a story. At the end, I used PHP (with an MySQL database connection) in order to fulfill the call-to-action requirement that I believe mandatory in a such project.
